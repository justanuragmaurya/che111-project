    <p class="b">Climate change refers to significant and long-term alterations in Earth's climate patterns and conditions, particularly with respect to temperature, precipitation, and weather events. It is primarily driven by human activities, such as the burning of fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, which release greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun, leading to the greenhouse effect and causing global temperatures to rise. This increase in temperature can result in a wide range of environmental and societal impacts, including rising sea levels, more frequent and severe weather events, altered ecosystems, and disruptions to agriculture and water resources. Mitigating climate change and adapting to its effects are crucial global challenges to reduce its negative consequences on the planet and human well-being.</p>
    <p class="i">Climate change is primarily caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases into the Earth's atmosphere. These greenhouse gases trap heat from the sun and lead to a rise in global temperatures, which results in changes to the climate. The main causes of climate change include:</p>
    <p class="h">1.Burning Fossil Fuels:</p>
    <p class="j">The combustion of fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, for energy production, transportation, and industrial processes releases carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This is the largest single contributor to climate change.</p>

   <p class="h">2.Deforestation:</p>
    <p class="j">The clearing of forests for agriculture, urban development, and other purposes reduces the planet's capacity to absorb CO2, as trees and forests act as carbon sinks.</p>

    <p class="h">3.Agriculture:</p>
    <p class="j">The agricultural sector contributes to climate change through activities like livestock farming (which produces methane) and the use of synthetic fertilizers (which release nitrous oxide).</p>

    <p class="h">4.Industrial Processes:</p>
    <p class="j">Certain industrial activities release greenhouse gases like methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. For example, agriculture and the production of cement are significant sources of these gases.</p>

    <p class="h">6.Waste Management:</p>
    <p class="j">Landfills and the decomposition of organic waste in anaerobic conditions produce methane emissions.</p>

    <p class="h">7.Use of HFCs, PFCs, and SF6:</p>
    <p class="j">Certain industrial chemicals, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6), are potent greenhouse gases used in various applications, including refrigeration, air conditioning, and electronics manufacturing</p>

    <p class="h">8.Natural Processes:</p>
    <p class="j">While human activities are the primary drivers of contemporary climate change, natural processes like volcanic eruptions and variations in solar radiation can also influence the climate. However, these natural factors are currently overwhelmed by the effects of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
